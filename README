We are using google closure library for dependencies and utilities.
It comes distributed with our repo. You can get google's through subversion if you like:
svn checkout http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ closure-library

We'll soon be distributing closure-script, when we start compiling.

If you have ruby and the rack gem installed on your machine, you can just:
rackup
then surf to http://localhost:9292/domekit.html

If you have ruby but need rack, grab it with:
gem install rack

Thanks!!!
